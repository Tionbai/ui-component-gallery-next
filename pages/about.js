          Hi!
          <br />
          <br />
          I'm Tina, and this is my personal UI webdesign project.
          <br />
          <br />
          The goal is to have fun and design UI web components and layouts using
          mainly CSS/Sass. There is very limited logic (JavaScript) used on
          these components, and if so, it is related to design rather than
          functionality.
          <br />
          <br />
          The key focus areas for each component is visual harmony, clean,
          structured and modern code, great responsiveness for all screen sizes
          and devices, and cross-browser compatibility.
          <br />
          <br />
          All of the components are made completely from scratch following
          semantic HTML, CSS BEM and Material Designâ„¢ principles. The designs
          themselves have been found from various online sources - especially
          but not limited to{" "}
